                    Small story short, I joined the Drum and Lyre corps. when I was in Elementary and after<br> 
                    that I've always wanted to play in a band. I've never been in a band, so if you know<br> 
                    someone that needs a drummer, you know who to call :)<br> 
                    I'm a great drummer, if I say so myself.</li>

                    <li><span >ETC</span><br>I've always liked dragon fruit and mangoes. I also like salty foods, burgers, and fruit shakes.<br> 
                        I try to maintain my physical and mental health at a healthy level, I always try to help someone<br>
                        who is in need whenever possible. My strengths are, I am self-motivated, hard-working, and a very<br>
                        disciplined person. I'm that kind of person when given a specific task he will do it with the<br>
                        utmost of his ability. My goal is to graduate from college and get a job in a reputed company<br>
                        and get a position where I can build my career and earn money so that I can pay off my debt<br>
                        to my parents and also so that I can buy the things that I've always wanted.</li>

                       At one point I was watching this documentary about dangerous roads in the world, I was enjoying
                       it too much that I did not notice the time. It was already 2:00 am Haha!

                    <p>I would play online multiplayer games with my homies all day, all night long back in the day,
                        but now we rarely play together, probably because we're already in college and things do get busy
                        sometimes. But this is one of my favorite hobbies, I've been playing games since elementary.
